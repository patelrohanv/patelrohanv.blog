### About
`Howdy, I'm Rohan, a tech enthusiast living in Austin, TX. Did my undergrad at Pitt in Comp Sci and lived in Pittsburgh for about a decade, then moved to Austin. Professional software engineer, part time coding instructor, dnd player, dog dad, and amateur amateur photographer, struggling gardener, Trader Joe's enthusiast and grad school dropout who enjoys: cooking, fermenting (kombucha, water kefir, milk kefir), coffee, technology, comicbooks, Star Wars, Dr. Who, weeb stuff, boardgames, reading, spirituality, hiking, and lists.

I don't much for social media so this is my place to post things I want to post.

### About This
This site was built using [Fernfolio](https://tylerroderick.com/projects/fernfolio/) by [Tyler M. Roderick](https://www.tylerroderick.com/)

Went with Tyler's plugin because it's an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) theme that is tightly integrated with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for flexible, Git-powered content management.
