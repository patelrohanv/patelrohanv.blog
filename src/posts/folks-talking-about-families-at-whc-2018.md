Back at World Hindu Congress in 2018 many uncles there were complaining about how Hindu couples need to start having more kids because other religions are having more kid and will "outnumber" us. First of all, more kids != more followers of that faith, there's no guarantee that kids will follow what their parents believe in. One uncle went as far as to say Hindus are well off enough to be able to afford kids so that's not an excuse. Well uncle, not sure knew but not all Hindus are well off; even if they are well off you don't have any right to try to shame them for choices; also not sure how much it cost to raise your kids way back when but they definitely aren't cheap.

Just though I'd drop this blurb below from *Though Revolution: A Western Introduction to the Work of Acharya Shriram Sharma.*

> "Looking a the increasing population of the country, economic difficulties, lack of resources, and the degraded health of the common man, it is appropriate that each couple should have the fewest children possible, \[ . . . ] It should be well understood by couples that reducing the responsibilities and tensions of child rearing will reduce both health problems and stress.
