## Python Recap

### Video

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMxo3T_MTvY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMxo3T_MTvY) <- great 100second overview of VS Code (fireship)
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YDVJaItmaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YDVJaItmaY) <- this is a great video just giving y'all a high level overview of web dev to help give context for what all this content can build up to. the python track focuses on having you comfortable with APIs, databases, infrastructure
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1elmMBnykA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1elmMBnykA) <- is a good overview of Python as a language. The beginning up to 54:38 , gives a good overview of variables, data types, functions, and conditionals/loops; the rest is nice to know but is way out of scope for what you'd be expected to know as a beginner. 1:04:17 to 1:11:02 gives a good recap of objects
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgRUr-YUk1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgRUr-YUk1Q) <- 100second overview of modules/packages (it's in JS but the concepts still apply to python) (fireship)

## Python SQL
