I first started this blog back in June 2017, when I had spoken with Dr. Pranav Pandya, but by August that same year, it had quickly died.



A lot's changed since 2017. I've since graduated from Pitt; started my first "real" job at BNY Mellon; started and dropped out of a Masters Program; left BNY Mellon for Seegrid; saw the start a global pandemic; moved halfway across the country to Austin after almost a decade in Pittsburgh; and now most recently, left Seegrid to take some time and figure out what I want to do next.



So what is it I want to do?



Well, Iâ€™ve been thinking about that and I thought back to what my thoughts were when I was failing out of premed, back then I was thought about what my most consistent interest has been my whole life, tech; and since 2016, journaling.



So why not combine then and start writing about that: personal projects I do in my home lab and pc; code I write for fun and toss up or GitHub; or interesting problems I come across studying for interviews.



I already hardy use social media, and my instagram at this point is just occasional pictures of Poppy. So this looks like it, my own personal place to shout nonsense into the void ðŸ˜‚
